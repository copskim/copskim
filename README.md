## 🚀 About Me

Ever since I graduated from Seoul National University with a degree in Mathematics, I’ve been driven by a curiosity for how things work—and how to make them work even better. My journey has taken me from Unix system development in the 1980s, to leading-edge laser and fanfold printer controllers, to data-driven printing and plotting solutions for some of Korea’s largest industries.

I love to build things that bridge hardware and software, and I thrive on solving tough technical challenges—whether it’s optimizing firmware for resource-constrained devices, designing robust printing solutions, or leading large-scale software projects.
